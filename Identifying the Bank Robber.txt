Identifying the Bank Robber
 
Using table playground.suspect, filter out suspects who cannot be the bank robber based on the following clues: the robber is not taller than 170cm, and their name matches the pattern "B. Gre?n" where the first letter of the name is "B" or "b" and the surname is similar to "Green" but with the fourth letter being unreadable and potentially any character. The match should be case-insensitive. For each suspect that fits these criteria, select their id, name, and surname. Order the results by suspect id in ascending order.

These are the tables to query for this question:
playground.suspect
id int
name string
surname string
height int
weight int
Your answer should include these columns:

id integer
name varchar
surname varchar

<<This solution which i first solved is wrong>> Regex is not my best 

SELECT * FROM playground.suspect LIMIT 100

select id, name, surname from playground.suspect
where height<170 and name not in ('B%'or'b%' )and surname not in ('Gre%n')
order by 1 asc 


 select 
  id, 
  name, 
  surname
from playground.suspect
where height <= 170
and REGEXP_LIKE(
    concat(name, ' ', surname), 
    '(?i)^B.*Gre.n$'
  )
order by id asc
