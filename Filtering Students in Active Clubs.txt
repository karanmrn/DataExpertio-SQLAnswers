Filtering Students in Active Clubs
 
Given tables clubs (id: unique club id, name: club name) and students (id: unique student id, name: student name, club_id: club's id), return a list from the students table for those who are in clubs that still exist in the clubs table. The result should have three columns (id, name, club_id) and be sorted by students' ids (id) and include only those students whose club_id matches an id in the clubs table.

These are the tables to query for this question:
playground.clubs
id int
name string
playground.students
id int
name string
club_id int
Your answer should include these columns:
id integer
name varchar
club_id integer
