Top Reviewed Customers per Product
 
Using the table playground.product_reviews, write a SQL query to identify, for each product, the customer who provided the highest review score. If there are ties in review score, the customer with the most helpful votes should be considered top. The output should include columns for product_id, customer_id, review_score, and helpful_votes, capturing the details of the top review for each product ordered in ascending order of product_id

These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.product_reviews
seller_id int
customer_id int
product_id int
review_date date
review_score double
helpful_votes int

Your answer should include these columns:

product_id integer
customer_id integer
review_score double
helpful_votes integer

with cte as (select product_id, customer_id, review_score, helpful_votes,
rank() over (partition by customer_id order by review_score desc, helpful_votes desc) as ranked 
from playground.product_reviews)
select product_id, customer_id, review_score, helpful_votes from cte
where ranked=1
order by 1 asc
