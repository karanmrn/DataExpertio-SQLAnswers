1. Find Viewers with Multiple Article Views in a Day(EASY)
 
Using the table playground.views, write a SQL query to identify all viewers who viewed more than one article on the same day. 
The table includes columns viewer_id (the ID of the viewer), article_id (the ID of the article viewed),
and view_date (the date of the view). The result should contain a single column named viewer_id,
listing each viewer who meets the criteria without duplicates, and should be sorted in ascending order of viewer_id.

These are the tables to query for this question:
playground.views
article_id int
author_id int
viewer_id int
view_date date

Your answer should include these columns:
viewer_id integer

Write Your Query Here (you can run selections by highlighting!)

SELECT viewer_id from 
(SELECT viewer_id,view_date,count(distinct article_id) as article_views from playground.views
group by view_date,viewer_id) as subquery
where article_views>1
order by 1
