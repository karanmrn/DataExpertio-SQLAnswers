Identifying Empty Departments
 
Given two tables, playground.employees and playground.departments, with employees containing id, full_name, and department, and departments containing id (unique department ID) and dep_name (department name), write a SQL query to build a table with one column, dep_name. This table should list all the departments that currently have no employees, sorted by the department id.

These are the tables to query for this question:
playground.employees
id int
full_name string
department int
playground.departments
id int
dep_name string
Your answer should include these columns:
dep_name varchar


Write Your Query Here (you can run selections by highlighting!)

select pd.dep_name fom playground.departments pd left join playground.employees pe on pd.id=pe.department
where pe.id is null
order by pd.id

select departments.dep_name
from playground.departments
left join playground.employees on departments.id = employees.department
where employees.id is null
order by departments.id
