Check Test Answers
 
Create a SQL query to evaluate test answers stored in a table named playground.answers with columns id (unique question ID), correct_answer (string), and given_answer (which can be NULL). Return a table with columns id and checks, where checks is "no answer" if given_answer is NULL, "correct" if given_answer matches correct_answer, and "incorrect" otherwise. Order the results by id.

These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.answers
id int
correct_answer string
given_answer string

Your answer should include these columns:
id integer
checks varchar

My solution:

select id, 
case when given_answer is null then 'no answer' 
when given_answer = correct_answer then 'correct'
else 'incorrect' end as checks
from playground.answers
