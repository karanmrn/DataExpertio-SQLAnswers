Calculate Average Lead Time for Each Shipping Option
 
Using the playground.superstore table, write a SQL query to calculate the average lead time from order to shipping for each shipping option. The lead time is defined as the number of days from the order date to the ship date. Additionally, count the total number of shipping services provided for each shipping option. The output should include the shipping mode (ship_mode), the total count of shipping services (total_shipping_service), and the average lead time (avg_lead_time), rounded to two decimal places. Order the results by shipping mode in descending order.

These are the tables to query for this question:
playground.superstore
row_id int
order_id string
order_date date
ship_date date
ship_mode string
customer_id string
customer_name string
segment string
country string
city string
state string
postal_code int
region string
product_id string
category string
sub_category string
product_name string
sales string
quantity string
discount string
profit double
Your answer should include these columns:
ship_mode varchar
total_shipping_service integer
avg_lead_time double

SELECT ship_mode, count(*) as total_shipping_service ,round(avg(date_diff('day', order_date, ship_date)),2) as avg_lead_time
 FROM playground.superstore
 group by
  ship_mode
order by
  ship_mode desc
